# Java Project

<p>I love playing Dungeons and Dragons and wanted to see if I could create a character creator</p>

<p>It is a simple GUI that has organized text fields and text boxes. I tried to manipulate the data in the fields and use conditionals and didn't have any success.</p>

# Eclipse

<p>I used Eclipse to develop this project. I tried to use window builder for the GUI but I couldn't get it to work.</p>

<p>I used Java and had to import alot of libraries. Thankfully Eclipse tends to do alot of that stuff automaticly.</p>
